# Project Status

## Completed Steps
- Converted codebase to use Azure OpenAI API
- Implemented LangGraph workflow to replace CrewAI
- Created structured workflow for cancer staging
- Resolved Azure connection issues
- Added detailed logging for better debugging
- Added verbose mode to display agent reasoning
- Improved CSV output with cleaner data extraction
- Enhanced markdown report formatting
- Updated documentation with instructions for alternative LLM providers

## Current Status
The cancer staging system now uses LangGraph for a more robust workflow, with proper integration with Azure OpenAI. The workflow now follows these steps:
1. Identify cancer type from medical note
2. Map to standardized cancer type
3. Analyze staging criteria if cancer is covered by Toronto system
4. Calculate cancer stage based on criteria
5. Generate comprehensive staging report

Output generation has been improved with:
- Cleaner CSV data with better value extraction and reliable stage identification
- Well-formatted markdown reports with proper headers and consistent formatting
- Improved data extraction from LLM responses

Documentation now includes details on:
- Azure OpenAI API configuration
- Instructions for converting to standard OpenAI or other providers
- Links to LangChain and LangGraph documentation
- Updated usage information and output formats

For transparency and debugging, the system can display the full agent responses at each step, showing how the LLMs reason about the medical text and make staging decisions.

## Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Add unit tests for the LangGraph workflow
- Implement more structured output parsing
- Add support for batch processing of multiple notes
- Implement visualization of the LangGraph workflow
- Create provider-specific configuration modules for easy switching between LLM providers
